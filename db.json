Robed men sell ornate carpets and a camel nibbles affectionately at your ear.  OK, we’re pretty sure Paul McKenna’s job is safe for now, but get cooking this recipe and take dinnertime on a magic carpet ride to Casablanca! Our tip for this recipe is to take your meat out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before dinner which will allow you to cook it more evenly.",

For our intern Simon, it was this lip-smackingly awesome Sea Bream. Taking the warm crunchiness of potatoes against the fresh southern asian flavours of fish with coriander, ginger and lime, it’s the perfect dish for transporting your tastebuds. Don’t let the smell of the fish sauce throw you - add it gradually to your sauce for a really authentic asian spin!",

For Head Chef Patrick it’s all about Swiss Roll. A firm dinnertime favourite from his primary school years, we still see him go all misty eyed at the mere mention of it. We’re pretty sure that was the inspiration behind this little number. Tonight, prepare to create a little nostalgia that the little ‘uns will remember for years!",

Think about it - everything you eat with only a fork is usually delicious. Dispense with cutlery entirely to use your fingers and suddenly you’re in taste bud paradise. That was the thinking behind this Japanese favourite. A surefire winner in the eateries of Tokyo, pick it up with your fingers and get stuck in!

Garlic, sour cream, lemon zest, and butter come together harmoniously in mere minutes.
